Gulps lets you track your daily water intake in a simple and intuitive way: set your goal, set your usual portion, and start keeping track from within the app or the widget in your notification center.  

This app is available in the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gulps/id979057304?ls=1&mt=8). Learn more [here](http://www.fancypixel.it/gulps/index.html).
